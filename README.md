# Digital Image Processing with OpenCV

This repository contains code for digital image processing using OpenCV. The provided code demonstrates various image processing techniques, including adding noise, applying filters, and removing noise from images.

## Files Included

1. **main.py**: This is the main Python script that uses OpenCV for digital image processing. It loads the image from the matrix file, applies noise filters, and performs other image processing operations.

2. **matrix_file.txt**: The matrix file contains the pixel values of the image. It serves as the input for the image processing script.

## Getting Started

Follow these steps to get started with digital image processing:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Zilean12/DIGITAL-Image-Processing.git
    ```

2. Install the required dependencies.

    ```bash
    pip install opencv-python
    ```

3. Run the `main.py` script to perform digital image processing.

    ```bash
    python main.py
    ```

## Functionality

### 1. Adding Noise

The script adds different types of noise to the image, simulating real-world scenarios. You can modify the noise parameters in the script to experiment with different noise levels.

### 2. Noise Filtering

Various noise filtering techniques are applied to the image to reduce or eliminate the added noise. This includes commonly used filters such as Gaussian, Median, and Bilateral filters.

### 3. Other Image Processing Operations

The script also demonstrates other image processing operations, such as resizing, grayscale conversion, and edge detection.

## Customize the Code

Feel free to modify the code to suit your specific image processing needs. Experiment with different filters, noise levels, and image processing techniques.
